## How to run it
To run the simulation, clone the repository and type the command `make`. After that, launch `./app.exe`.\
Once your app is running, press `Space` or right click mouse to spawn a new ball.\

**Note**: to build this project I used MacOs 13.6 with SFML. If you try to run this on your machine, you should change the SFML path in Makefile.
